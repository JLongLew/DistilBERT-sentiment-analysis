## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JLongLew/DistilBERT-sentiment-analysis.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train a DistilBERT AI Model by navigating to AIModel/DistilBERT_Model_Training.ipynb and run the program

4. Once the model is fine-tuned successfully (a new folder called 'DistilBERT_model' will be created in AIModel folder), run the following command to start the real-time sentiment analysis:
```bash
python AIModel/sentiment_analysis.py
```

5. Run the following command to start the Flask application:
```bash
python run.py
```
